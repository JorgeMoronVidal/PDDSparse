# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies

# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
LFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   To ling libusb-1.0 :
#   LIBS = -lusb-1.0

# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
#   $(name:string1=string2)
